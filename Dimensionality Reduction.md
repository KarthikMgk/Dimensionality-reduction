## What is dimensionality reduction
Human beings are three dimensional creatures. They can only percieve dimensions which are lesser than or equal to 3. But the data we produce are not neccesarily in three dimensions

If you look at iris dataset, "the hello word" dataset the number of dimensions in it are 4 namely petal length and width, Sepal length and width.
The technique by which we change imperceivable stuff to something which can be perceived by human brain is called dimensionality reduction

While working with data, We always visualize to get a sense of what's happening in the data. So for humans to visualize something which is a 100 dimension, only by reducing the dimension to 2 will we be able to make sense of what is happening in the data
